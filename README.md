# ErlXSL - XSLT Bindings for Erlang

The aim of this project is to provide a usable binding for Erlang to call native XSLT processors. The implementation aims to provide a choice between running the native code as an external port program or a linked-in driver. We also hope to provide an API allowing for a choice of XSLT processor providers.
